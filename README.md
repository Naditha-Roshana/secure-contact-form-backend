🔐 Security Implementation

The application implements the following security measures:

    💠 Server-side form validation

    💠 PDO prepared statements to prevent SQL injection

    💠 Session-based access control for the admin panel

    💠 Restricted direct URL access to admin routes

Note: This project uses demo credentials for development purposes.
In production, password hashing and database-stored user authentication are recommended.
